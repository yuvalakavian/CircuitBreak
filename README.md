# CircuitBreak: Smart City Traffic Simulation

**CircuitBreak** is a simulation of smart city traffic systems, where cars move across roads, follow traffic lights, and obey traffic rules. The project leverages Pygame for visualization and simulates dynamic road networks with traffic lights and vehicle movements.

## Features

- **Smart Traffic Control**: Simulates traffic lights at intersections with green and red phases, affecting car movement.
- **Random Car Generation**: Cars are randomly spawned on roads and can move in four directions (North, South, East, West).
- **Grid-Based Road Layout**: A dynamic 15x15 grid where roads and intersections are created.
- **Car Movement Logic**: Cars move along roads, stop at red lights, and obey traffic rules.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/circuitbreak.git
    cd circuitbreak
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```

---

## Usage

To start the simulation:

1. Run the `main.py` script.

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. The simulation window will open, showing a grid-based city with roads and cars moving according to traffic lights.

## Controls

- **Escape**: Exit the simulation.
- **P**: Pause the simulation.

---

## Future Plans

- Add more realistic traffic behavior and flow.
- Improve car AI for better traffic management.
- Include more interactive features such as manual control over traffic lights.
